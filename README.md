# CaveX

CaveX is a Mechanical Engineering Honours Group at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. We have designed and are building a semi-autonomous robot for mapping cave systems such as the Naracoorte Cavex using SLAM and LiDAR. We are using a Velodyne PUCK, Dynamixel XL servos and a Jetson Nano and OpenCR1.0 control boards.

Here is the beautiful Alexandra Cave with active formations.

Here's the team doing a scan.

Here's the Naracoorte Cave system map courtesy of Craig Williams (UofA) that we are aiming to contribute to.

## Issues

Due to the XL-430-w250t and 2XL-430-w250t servos using a different control table to earlier motors, OpenSHC is not yet working fully on hardware.
