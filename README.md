# CaveX

CaveX is a Mechanical Engineering Honours Group at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. This is where all of our software lives.

We have designed and are building a semi-autonomous robot for mapping cave systems such as the Naracoorte Cavex using SLAM and LiDAR. We are using a Velodyne PUCK, Dynamixel XL servos and a Jetson Nano and OpenCR1.0 control boards.

Here is the beautiful Alexandra Cave with active formations.

Here's the Naracoorte Cave system map courtesy of Craig Williams (UofA) that we are aiming to contribute to.

## Issues

Due to the XL-430-w250t and 2XL-430-w250t servos using a different control table to earlier motors, OpenSHC is not yet working fully on our hardware.
